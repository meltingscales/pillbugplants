Your job is to build and maintain a Rust project called “pillbugplants.”  
It is a ratatui-based physics sandbox inspired by falling-sand games.  
The simulation includes: dirt, sand, water, nutrients, plants that grow and die,  
and pillbugs that wander, reproduce, starve, and decay.  

Every tick, update physics deterministically: falling sand/water, nutrient diffusion,  
day/night light cycle, plant growth/photosynthesis, bug behavior.  
Render ASCII tiles in ratatui each frame.  

After each file edit, make a commit and push.  
Keep a running TODO and design notes in `.agent/`.  
Focus on core engine and simulation; tests are secondary.
