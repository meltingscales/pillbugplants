# Pillbugplants - Consolidated Documentation

## Project Overview

A falling-sand style physics sandbox simulating a miniature ecosystem inspired by playground observations of pillbugs and plant life. The simulation runs deterministically with ASCII art rendering via ratatui.

## Core Philosophy & Architecture

### Design Philosophy
The simulation embodies a **deterministic physics sandbox** where simple rules create complex emergent behaviors. The focus is on the interplay between plants that grow and die, and pillbugs that wander, reproduce, and decay.

### System Architecture
```
World {
    tiles: Vec<Vec<TileType>>,      // Main simulation grid
    biome_map: Vec<Vec<Biome>>,     // Regional environmental data
    environmental_state: {...},     // Weather, seasons, time
}
```

Each tile represents one unit of space and can contain exactly one entity type. The system uses **cellular automata** principles for deterministic updates.

## Entity Systems

### Entity Lifecycle Management
All entities follow consistent aging patterns:
- **Plants**: Stems (0-255 age), Leaves (0-150), Buds (0-50), Flowers (0-100)
- **Pillbugs**: All segments (0-180 age), then decay (0-20 before nutrient)
- **Environmental**: Seeds (0-100), Spores (0-50), Water depth (0-255)

### Size Variation System
Three size categories affect all organisms:
- **Small**: 30% faster growth, 30% shorter life (5.6x lifespan multiplier), modified display characters
- **Medium**: Baseline values (8x lifespan multiplier), normal display
- **Large**: 20% slower growth, 40% longer life (11.2x lifespan multiplier), enhanced display characters

**Note**: Lifespans have been extended 8x from original values to allow for longer ecosystem observation.

### Plant Architecture
**Multi-segment design** with specialized functions:
- **PlantStem** (|): Primary structural support, vertical growth
- **PlantLeaf** (L): Photosynthesis organs, light-dependent growth
- **PlantBud** (o): Growth points that become branches or flowers
- **PlantBranch** (/): Diagonal expansion, Y-shaped growth patterns
- **PlantFlower** (*): Reproduction organs, seed production
- **PlantRoot** (r): Underground nutrient absorption network
- **PlantWithered** (x): Dying plant matter
- **PlantDiseased** (?): Infected plants that spread disease

### Animal Behavior System
**Multi-segment pillbugs** with intelligent decision-making:
- **PillbugHead** (@): Controls movement and feeding behavior
- **PillbugBody** (O): Main body segment
- **PillbugLegs** (w): Locomotive segment
- **PillbugDecaying** (â–‘): Dying pillbug parts

**Movement Strategies**:
```rust
MovementStrategy {
    SeekFood(direction),    // Nutrient-seeking behavior
    Social(direction),      // Attraction to other pillbugs  
    Avoid(direction),       // Escape from threats
    Explore,               // Random movement
    Rest,                  // Minimal activity
}
```

## Physics Systems

### Deterministic Updates
Each tick processes systems in fixed order:
1. **Rain generation** â†’ Environmental water addition
2. **Physics update** â†’ Gravity, water flow, settling
3. **Gravity application** â†’ Unsupported entity falling (NEW!)
4. **Wind effects** â†’ Seed/spore dispersal, particle movement  
5. **Plant support** â†’ Structural integrity checks
6. **Nutrient diffusion** â†’ Chemical spread simulation
7. **Life updates** â†’ Growth, aging, reproduction, death
8. **Entity spawning** â†’ New life generation

### Water Mechanics (Enhanced with Absorption)
- **Depth-based physics**: Higher depth = faster flow
- **Momentum system**: Falling water accumulates depth
- **Biome interaction**: Retention rates vary by environment
- **Water wetting earth**: Water can soak into dirt/sand instead of just piling up (NEW!)
- **Multi-level visualization**: 4 depth ranges with distinct characters

### Gravity System (NEW!)
- **Pillbug gravity**: Unsupported pillbug segments fall if no solid support
- **Connected segment logic**: Pillbugs with ground contact support connected segments
- **Loose particle physics**: Seeds, spores, and nutrients fall at different rates
- **Support detection**: Checks for dirt, sand, plants, and connected pillbug parts

### Wind System
- **Seasonal patterns**: Direction changes with seasons (Spring easterly â†’ Fall westerly)
- **Particle interaction**: Seeds/spores/light particles affected by wind vectors
- **Collision physics**: Wind can displace small water droplets
- **Environmental feedback**: Plant reproduction responds to dispersal effectiveness

## Environmental Systems

### Biome Variation
Four distinct biome types create **microenvironmental diversity**:

**Wetland**: High moisture retention (1.4x), excellent plant growth (1.3x), frequent pooling
**Grassland**: Balanced conditions (1.0x), moderate growth, baseline environment  
**Drylands**: Low moisture (0.6x), sparse vegetation (0.7x), quick water loss, sandy terrain
**Woodland**: Dense growth (1.5x), rich nutrients (1.4x), high moisture retention (1.2x)

### Seasonal Dynamics
**Four-season cycle** (1600 ticks per season):
- **Spring**: Growth season, high humidity (0.7), mild temperature (0.3), easterly winds
- **Summer**: Hot season, low humidity (0.3), high temperature (0.8), southerly winds  
- **Fall**: Moderate temperature (0.1), increasing humidity (0.6), westerly storm winds
- **Winter**: Cold season (-0.5), variable humidity (0.4), northerly winds
