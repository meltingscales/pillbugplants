# Pillbugplants Design Notes

## Current Implementation Status (2025-08-26)

### ‚úÖ Implemented Core Features
- Basic ratatui terminal UI with dynamic world sizing
- Physics simulation: gravity, falling sand/water, support checking
- Tile-based world with dirt, sand, water, nutrients, multi-segment plants, multi-segment pillbugs
- Day/night cycle affecting plant reproduction and rain
- **Multi-segment plant system**:
  - PlantStem (|): Structural support, consumes nutrients, grows buds
  - PlantLeaf (L): Photosynthesis, produces nutrients during day
  - PlantBud (o): Growth points that develop into stems/leaves/flowers
  - PlantFlower (*): Reproduction, spreads seeds during day
- **Multi-segment pillbug system** (NEW!):
  - PillbugHead (@): Eats plants, coordinates movement and reproduction
  - PillbugBody (O): Main body segment, ages with head
  - PillbugLegs (w): Locomotion segment, ages with body
- Life systems:
  - Plants have specialized parts with different lifespans and behaviors
  - Pillbugs now have 3-segment bodies, heads eat plants, bodies/legs follow
  - All segments age (0-180) and decompose into nutrients when they die
  - Nutrient diffusion and cycling
- Rain system during night cycles
- Taxonomy panel (toggle with 't' key) with detailed descriptions
- 8-way support checking with structural plant support

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed (MAJOR UPDATE!)
- **Size variations**: Small/Medium/Large organisms with different lifespans & behaviors
- **Enhanced aging**: Size affects lifespan multipliers and growth rates  
- **Size-based interactions**: Large pillbugs eat plants more easily, especially small plants
- **Visual size differentiation**: Different Unicode characters (i|‚ïë, l L ≈Å, etc.)
- **Size inheritance**: Offspring inherit parent size with some variation
- **Balanced ecosystem**: Size creates natural population dynamics

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed Priority Issues (2025-08-26)
- **Compiler warnings**: ‚úÖ Fixed all clippy warnings, implemented Display trait
- **Pillbug coordination**: ‚úÖ Body/legs now follow head in coordinated chain movement
- **Plant physics**: ‚úÖ Advanced stability system with size-based support calculations
- **Gradual decomposition**: ‚úÖ Multi-stage decay: PlantWithered, PillbugDecaying states

### üéØ Next Development Priorities
1. ‚úÖ ~~Implement multi-segment plant bodies (stems, buds, leaves, flowers)~~
2. ‚úÖ ~~Add plant branching and bud development system~~  
3. ‚úÖ ~~Create multi-segment pillbug bodies (head, segments, legs)~~
4. ‚úÖ ~~Add size variations for organisms (small/medium/large)~~
5. ‚úÖ ~~Fix compiler warnings and clean up unused code~~
6. ‚úÖ ~~Improve pillbug multi-segment movement coordination~~
7. ‚úÖ ~~Enhance plant support/attachment physics~~
8. ‚úÖ ~~Add gradual withering/decay stages~~

**ALL HIGH PRIORITY ITEMS COMPLETED! üéâ**

### üÜï Latest Features Added (2025-08-26 Session)
- **Enhanced Code Quality**: All clippy warnings fixed, Display trait implemented
- **Coordinated Movement**: Pillbug body segments follow head in formation  
- **Multi-Stage Decay**: PlantWithered ('x') and PillbugDecaying ('‚ñë') intermediate states
- **Advanced Physics**: Size-based stability with weighted support strength calculations
- **Visual Improvements**: New decay characters and color gradients for aging
- **Ecosystem Balance**: Withered plants easier for pillbugs to eat, creating natural cleanup

## Technical Architecture

### Core Types
- `TileType` enum for all world materials
- `World` struct managing simulation state
- `App` struct for UI and user interaction
- Deterministic physics updates each tick

### Simulation Loop
1. Rain spawning (night cycles)
2. Physics updates (gravity, falling, support)
3. Nutrient diffusion
4. Life updates (aging, reproduction, movement)

### UI Features
- Terminal-based with ratatui
- Dynamic world sizing based on terminal
- Color-coded tiles with aging effects
- Info panel with tick count, day/night, rain status
- Toggle-able taxonomy reference panel
