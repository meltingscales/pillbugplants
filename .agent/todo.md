# Pillbugplants TODO

## High Priority - Core Systems Enhancement

### Multi-Segment Bodies
- [x] ✅ Design plant segment system (stem, bud, leaf, flower)
- [x] ✅ Implement plant body structure with connected segments  
- [ ] Design pillbug segment system (head, body segments, legs)
- [ ] Implement pillbug multi-segment bodies
- [ ] Add size variations (small/medium/large organisms)

### Advanced Plant Growth  
- [x] ✅ Implement bud development system (bud → stem/leaf/flower)
- [x] ✅ Add plant branching patterns and growth rules
- [x] ✅ Create flower development and seed dispersal
- [x] ✅ Implement withering/falling mechanics for plant parts
- [ ] Add different plant species with unique growth patterns

### Enhanced Physics & Decay
- [ ] Implement gradual decomposition (not instant nutrients)
- [ ] Add organic matter tile type for decomposing material
- [ ] Improve support checking for multi-segment organisms
- [ ] Add structural integrity for complex plant structures

## Medium Priority - Behavior & Ecosystem

### Pillbug Behavior
- [ ] Improve movement AI (pathfinding toward food/mates)
- [ ] Add group behavior and pheromone trails
- [ ] Implement pillbug lifecycle stages (egg, larva, adult)
- [ ] Add digging behavior (pillbugs can move dirt/sand)

### Environmental Features  
- [ ] Add seasonal cycles affecting growth rates
- [ ] Implement soil quality affecting plant growth
- [ ] Add wind effects on seeds/spores
- [ ] Create temperature zones affecting organism behavior

## Low Priority - Polish & Extensions

### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Add pause/speed controls
- [ ] Implement save/load world state
- [ ] Add statistics panel (population counts, etc.)
- [ ] Create interactive placement tools

### Additional Materials
- [ ] Add stone/rock tiles
- [ ] Implement different soil types
- [ ] Add organic debris pile tile type
- [ ] Create water flow improvements

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Refactor large update functions into smaller modules
- [ ] Add proper error handling
- [ ] Consider performance optimizations for large worlds
- [ ] Add unit tests for core simulation logic
