# TODO - Pillbug Plants

## Current Status
- Basic ratatui-based physics sandbox implemented
- Falling sand/water physics working
- Day/night cycle implemented
- Basic plant growth during daylight
- Pillbug random movement
- ASCII rendering with colored tiles

## Next Iterations
- [ ] More complex plant structures (segments, buds, branches, flowers)
- [ ] Plant photosynthesis and nutrient consumption
- [ ] Pillbug reproduction and starvation mechanics
- [ ] Nutrient diffusion system
- [ ] Plant decomposition when they die
- [ ] More realistic physics (velocity, momentum)
- [ ] Better collision detection
- [ ] Save/load world state
