# Pillbugplants TODO

## Current Status
- âœ… Basic simulation engine with physics sandbox
- âœ… Multi-size entities (plants and pillbugs with small/medium/large variants)
- âœ… Plant growth system with stems, leaves, buds, branches, flowers
- âœ… Y-shaped plant branching system
- âœ… Pillbug multi-segment bodies (head-body-legs)
- âœ… Size-based feeding efficiency for pillbugs
- âœ… Intelligent movement with MovementStrategy enum (including Avoid strategy)
- âœ… Comprehensive danger detection (larger pillbugs, water, unstable ground)
- âœ… Advanced plant root system with active nutrient absorption
- âœ… Seasonal weather system (Spring/Summer/Fall/Winter cycles)
- âœ… Temperature and humidity affecting all growth rates
- âœ… Day/night cycle with seasonal rain patterns
- âœ… Nutrient diffusion system
- âœ… Reproduction systems for both plants and pillbugs
- âœ… All utility methods (`is_plant`, `is_pillbug`, `get_size`) fully utilized
