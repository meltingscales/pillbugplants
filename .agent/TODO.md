## Recent Achievements
- ðŸŽ‰ All compiler warnings resolved - ecosystem now uses all intended features
- ðŸŽ‰ Seasonal ecosystem dynamics create realistic environmental pressures

- ðŸŽ‰ Underground root networks actively reshape nutrient distribution
- ðŸŽ‰ Plant disease/infection system with seasonal spread patterns and ecosystem pressure
- ðŸŽ‰ **Comprehensive biome variation system** with four distinct microenvironments:
  * **Wetland**: High moisture retention, lush plant growth, water pooling
  * **Grassland**: Balanced conditions, moderate growth and moisture
  * **Drylands**: Low moisture, sparse vegetation, quick evaporation, sandy soil
  * **Woodland**: Dense plant growth, rich nutrients, extensive root systems
- ðŸŽ‰ Biome-influenced terrain generation, water physics, and plant ecology
- ðŸŽ‰ Regional biome maps with natural boundaries create realistic ecological gradients
- ðŸŽ‰ **Sophisticated water flow and pooling mechanics** with depth-based physics:
  * **Depth visualization**: Droplets (Â·), normal (~), deep (â‰ˆ), very deep (â–ˆ) water
  * **Pressure-driven flow**: Deeper water flows more readily, creates realistic streams
  * **Biome-specific pooling**: Wetlands retain water, drylands drain quickly
  * **Momentum physics**: Falling water gains depth, water seeks equilibrium levels
  * **Enhanced evaporation**: Depth, biome, temperature, and day/night affect evaporation rates
- ðŸŽ‰ **Comprehensive wind effects system** with realistic particle dispersal:
  * **Dynamic wind patterns**: Seasonal direction changes (Spring easterly, Fall westerly)
  * **Seed dispersal mechanics**: Flowers produce seeds that travel with wind currents
  * **Spore transmission**: Diseased plants generate airborne spores for infection spread
  * **Size-based wind susceptibility**: Small seeds highly mobile, large seeds more stable
  * **Environmental feedback**: Wind strength affects seed/spore generation rates
  * **Particle physics**: Wind-particle collisions can displace light water droplets
  * **Lifecycle systems**: Seeds age, germinate, or decay; spores spread disease then fade
- ðŸŽ‰ **ECOSYSTEM MATURITY MILESTONE** - 1000-tick comprehensive simulation demonstrates:
  * **Multi-generational complexity**: Extensive plant communities spanning multiple life cycles
  * **Advanced water physics**: Deep pools, flowing streams, droplet formations showing sophisticated fluid dynamics  
  * **Diverse pillbug populations**: Multiple age groups and sizes coexisting with realistic lifespans
  * **Seasonal ecosystem evolution**: Full winter-to-spring transitions with temperature-driven changes
  * **Emergent ecosystem behaviors**: Self-organizing communities, resource competition, and natural selection
